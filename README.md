<h1>Incident Report Analysis</h1>

<b>An incident report is a concise document detailing a security event, like a data breach or malware attack. It includes when and how the incident occurred, its impact, and the response taken. This report serves to document the incident, aid in analysis and investigation, communicate with stakeholders, and identify areas for improvement in security measures.</b>


<h2>The 6 Different Sections</h2>

<b>

- Summary
- Identify
- Protect
- Detect
- Respond
- Recover

The 6 different sections detail the security incident clearly and was based off a DDoS attack on my system's infrastructure. This was an imaginary scenario but was used for the purpose of creating an incident report that is realistic to what can happen to a business.
